Technologies: Built using HTML, Css, Node.js, Express, Atlas, Heroku, Bootstrap & font awesome.

Approach taken: A online platform where users can check out amazing guitars and buy them. Built the app and used heroku and atlas database to deploy the app to the internet.

Notes: nedd to add more instruments,
            make a home page for all the instruments,
           add a cart,
          make search bar functionality,
          make edit and delete function available to admin only by creating an admin user,
          work on footer

Unsolved problems: any one can edit and delete the product,
                   footer does not align in the sign up and log in pages  so I just removed it from there.
                   some issues with images height adjustment.
